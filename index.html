    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h3>Hello</h3>
    <p><strong>Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself.</strong> What? We're not at all alike! You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. <em>Wouldn't that bring about chaos?</em> I'll be sure to note that in my log. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. <em><strong>Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?</strong></em> Your shields were failing, sir. This should be interesting. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. <strong>Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.</strong> Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. You enjoyed that. Besides, you look good in a dress. <em><strong>When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?</strong></em> Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. <em><strong>When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?</strong></em> Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.</p>
    <h3>Goodbye</h3>
    <p> And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. <strong>They were just sucked into space.</strong> <em>Talk about going nowhere fast.</em> Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would <em><strong>never</strong></em> do that to you. Not if I weaken first. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The unexpected is our normal routine. <strong>Sorry, Data. Maybe we better talk out here;</strong> <em>the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.</em> This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. <em>I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.</em></p>
